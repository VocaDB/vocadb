# Contributing to VocaDB

## Feature requests
VocaDB's new feature development is tracked as GitHub issues. This includes bug fixes.
If VocaDB is lacking a feature that you are expecting, you may submit a feature request on GitHub. 
Please use the search to make sure that the feature has not already been requested. 
If the feature request has already been submitted by another user, you may give a "thumbs up" vote on the issue to help us 
prioritize it further.

When submitting a new feature request / issue, make sure you include as much information as possible. You also need to explain why do you need that specific feature: what are the use cases? Explain step by step how would you imagine the feature would work.

Please understand that unless the feature is extremely simple or requested by a very large number of users, 
it will take a long time for it to be implemented. Implementing a single feature may take anything from 1 hour to many weeks of concentrated work.

You're more than welcome to recruit another programmer to help with the implementation, if you cannot do it yourself. 
VocaDB is open source, just fork and send a pull request.

If you think you could help, take a look at the list of reported issues, 
create a fork and you can fix it there and create a pull request back to the main repository.
